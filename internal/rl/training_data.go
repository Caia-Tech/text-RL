significantly improves performance on diverse NLP tasks. Our method, termed Adaptive Task 
Prioritization (ATP), dynamically adjusts task weights during training based on gradient 
similarity and task-specific loss trajectories. Experiments on the GLUE benchmark demonstrate 
that ATP achieves state-of-the-art results on 7 out of 9 tasks, with an average improvement 
of 3.2% over baseline MTL approaches. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that ATP effectively 
mitigates negative transfer between dissimilar tasks while promoting positive transfer among 
related tasks.`,

Hi Team,

Following our strategic planning session last week, I'm sharing the updated Q3 roadmap priorities:

1. Customer Portal v2.0 - Target: July 15th
   - Enhanced dashboard with real-time analytics
   - Mobile-responsive design
   - SSO integration

2. API Rate Limiting - Target: August 1st
   - Implement tiered usage plans
   - Add monitoring and alerting

3. Performance Optimization - Ongoing
   - Database query optimization (30% improvement target)
   - CDN implementation for static assets

Please review and provide feedback by EOD Friday. We'll finalize during Monday's standup.

Best regards,
Sarah Chen
Product Manager`,
