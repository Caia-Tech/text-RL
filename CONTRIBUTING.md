## Submission Process

### Pull Requests

1. Create a feature branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes, ensuring:
   - Code follows project conventions
   - Tests are included and passing
   - Documentation is updated as needed

3. Commit your changes with clear, descriptive messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add experimental reward function for code analysis"
   ```

4. Push to your fork and submit a pull request

### Pull Request Template

Please include the following in your pull request:

- **Purpose**: What does this change accomplish?
- **Type**: Bug fix, new feature, experiment, documentation, etc.
- **Testing**: How was this tested?
- **Experimental Conditions**: If applicable, describe experimental setup
- **Limitations**: Any known limitations or concerns
- **Breaking Changes**: Any backward compatibility issues

### Issues

When reporting issues:

- Use clear, descriptive titles
- Provide steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Include relevant log output or error messages
- Specify your environment (Go version, OS, etc.)
- Note that this is experimental software with limited support

## Code Style

### Go Code
- Follow standard Go formatting (`gofmt`)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized
- Include appropriate error handling

### Comments
- Document exported functions and types
- Explain complex algorithms or experimental approaches
- Include references to research papers or methodologies where relevant

### Testing
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Include integration tests for complex features
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Test both success and error conditions

## Experimental Guidelines

### Research Integrity
- Document all experimental parameters
- Use appropriate controls and baselines
- Report both positive and negative results
- Avoid overgeneralization from limited experiments

### Reproducibility
- Include random seeds where applicable
- Document software versions and dependencies
- Provide clear instructions for reproducing experiments
- Share raw data when possible and appropriate

### Performance Claims
- Base claims on rigorous testing
- Include statistical analysis where appropriate
- Provide confidence intervals or error bars
- Acknowledge limitations of simulated environments

## Review Process

### Review Criteria
- Code quality and maintainability
- Experimental rigor and methodology
- Documentation completeness
- Alignment with project goals
- Safety and security considerations

### Timeline
- Initial review within 1-2 weeks
- May require multiple iterations for experimental contributions
