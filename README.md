# TextLib RL System

**Experimental reinforcement learning system for discovering text processing patterns**

This is an experimental research project that applies reinforcement learning to analyze and discover optimal usage patterns for text processing APIs. The system is provided as-is for research and educational purposes.

## ⚠️ Experimental Software

This software is experimental and should not be used in production environments. It is provided for research, educational, and experimental purposes only. No warranties or guarantees are provided regarding its functionality, reliability, or suitability for any particular purpose.

## Overview

This project explores using Q-learning to discover optimal sequences for text processing functions. The system trains an agent to learn effective patterns for different types of text analysis tasks.

## Features

- Q-learning agent for sequence optimization

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later
- Docker (optional, for containerized training)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/textlib-rl-system
cd textlib-rl-system
go mod download
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Build the system
go build -o rl-textlib-learner ./cmd/main.go

# Run training
./rl-textlib-learner --mode=train --episodes=100

# Generate report
./rl-textlib-learner --mode=generate-report --input=logs/insights.json
```

### Using Docker

```bash
# Build container
docker build -t textlib-rl-learner .

# Run training
make run-quick  # 100 episodes for testing
make run        # Standard training
```

## Configuration

The system can be configured via environment variables or config files:

```yaml
training:
  max_episodes: 1000
  learning_rate: 0.1
  exploration_rate: 1.0

logging:
  level: "info"
  batch_size: 100
```

## Research Findings

This experimental system has generated some preliminary findings about text processing patterns. These are documented in:

- `docs/discovered-patterns.md` - Raw experimental results
- `analysis/why-patterns-work.md` - Technical analysis
- `benchmarks/performance_report.md` - Performance measurements

**Note**: These findings are experimental and should be validated independently before any practical application.

## Benchmarking

To run performance comparisons:

```bash
cd benchmarks
go test -bench=. -benchmem
```

## Safety Features

The system includes several safety measures:

- Containerized execution with resource limits
- Read-only filesystem in containers
- No external network access during training
- Comprehensive logging for audit trails
- Simulation-only (no actual API calls)
