# Discovered Patterns from RL Analysis

## ⚠️ Experimental Research Findings

**DISCLAIMER**: This document contains preliminary experimental results from reinforcement learning research. These findings are not guaranteed to be accurate or applicable in real-world scenarios. Independent validation is required before any practical application.

## Overview

This document contains raw experimental data from reinforcement learning experiments exploring text processing patterns. The results are based on simulated environments and limited training data. These are research findings only.

## Experimental Results

### 1. Optimal Action Sequences

Based on our enhanced reward function analysis across 200 episodes:

#### Highest Reward Sequence (Avg Reward: 32.13)
```
validate_output → extract_entities → analyze_readability → extract_keywords → extract_entities
```

**Why this works:**
- **validate_output** (cost: 1) provides early quality check with minimal cost
- **extract_entities** (cost: 5) delivers high value for technical/legal/medical texts
- **analyze_readability** (cost: 3) complements entity extraction
- **extract_keywords** (cost: 4) enhances understanding
- Second **extract_entities** captures missed entities after readability analysis

#### Most Frequent Successful Pattern
```
extract_entities → extract_keywords → validate_output
```
- Used in 47% of successful episodes
- Average reward: 28.7
- Particularly effective for technical documentation

### 2. Function Performance Analysis

| Function | Avg Reward | Call Count | Success Rate | Avg Duration |
|----------|------------|------------|--------------|--------------|
| extract_entities | 2.82 | 934 | 100% | 0.06s |
| analyze_readability | 2.39 | 183 | 100% | 0.04s |
| validate_output | 2.36 | 308 | 100% | 0.02s |
| sentiment_analysis | 2.30 | 129 | 100% | 0.04s |
| extract_keywords | 2.12 | 144 | 100% | 0.05s |

### 3. Task-Specific Patterns

#### Technical Documentation (Redis, API docs)
```
Best sequence: detect_code → extract_entities → extract_keywords
Average reward: 29.4
Why: Code detection identifies technical content early, enabling targeted entity extraction
```

#### Academic/Research Papers
```
Best sequence: extract_entities → analyze_readability → summarize_text
Average reward: 27.8
Why: Entity extraction captures key concepts, readability analysis confirms complexity
```

#### Business Communications
```
Best sequence: sentiment_analysis → extract_entities → extract_keywords
Average reward: 26.2
Why: Sentiment provides context for entity interpretation
```

#### Social Media
```
Best sequence: sentiment_analysis → extract_keywords → format_text
Average reward: 24.5
Why: Sentiment is primary signal, keywords capture trends
```

### 4. Cost-Efficiency Analysis

#### Budget-Aware Patterns
When remaining budget < 30%:
- Prefer: validate_output (cost: 1), detect_code (cost: 2)
- Avoid: summarize_text (cost: 8), extract_entities (cost: 5)

#### High-Value Combinations
Best reward/cost ratios:
1. validate_output: 2.36 reward / 1 cost = 2.36 ratio
2. detect_code: 1.70 reward / 2 cost = 0.85 ratio
3. analyze_readability: 2.39 reward / 3 cost = 0.80 ratio

### 5. Learning Insights

#### Convergence Patterns
- Episodes 1-50: High exploration (90%), discovering action space
- Episodes 51-100: Rapid learning, Q-values stabilizing
- Episodes 101-150: Exploitation phase, refining sequences
- Episodes 151-200: Convergence, consistent high-reward patterns

#### Q-Value Evolution
```
Initial Q-values (Episode 1):
- All actions: 0.0

Final Q-values (Episode 200):
- extract_entities after validate_output: 6.82
- analyze_readability after extract_entities: 5.94
- validate_output as first action: 5.21
```

### 6. Unexpected Discoveries

#### Double Entity Extraction
The pattern `extract_entities → ... → extract_entities` emerged naturally:
- First extraction: captures obvious entities
- Intervening actions: provide context
- Second extraction: finds contextual entities missed initially
- Improvement: 23% more entities found

#### Sentiment-First for Certain Domains
For marketing and social media texts:
- Starting with sentiment_analysis improved overall reward by 31%
- Sentiment context helped subsequent functions perform better

### 7. Statistical Analysis

#### Action Transition Probabilities
Most likely transitions (>70% probability):
- validate_output → extract_entities (78%)
- extract_entities → extract_keywords (72%)
- analyze_readability → summarize_text (71%)

#### Reward Distribution
- Mean episode reward: 24.35
- Standard deviation: 4.82
- 95th percentile: 32.13
- Minimum viable sequence reward: 15.0

### 8. Failure Pattern Analysis

#### Ineffective Sequences
Patterns that consistently underperformed:
- Repeated same action >3 times: -48% reward
- summarize_text before analysis: -35% reward
- format_text as first action: -28% reward

### 9. Performance Metrics

#### Training Efficiency
- Learning rate impact: 0.1 optimal for convergence
- Exploration decay: 0.995 balanced exploration/exploitation
- Batch effects: Performance peaked at episode 167

#### Computational Cost
- Average episode duration: 0.46 seconds
